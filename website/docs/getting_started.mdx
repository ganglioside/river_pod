[Riverpod]의 내부 메커니즘에 대해 알아보기 전에 기본부터 시작하겠습니다. [Riverpod]를 설치한 다음 "Hello world"를 작성합니다.

<!-- Before diving into the inner mechanisms of [Riverpod], let's start with the basics:
Installing up [Riverpod], then writing a "Hello world". -->

## 설치해야 할 패키지

Before anything, you need to be aware that [Riverpod] is spread across multiple packages, with slightly different usage.  
The variant of [Riverpod] that you will want to install depends on the app you are making.

You can refer to the following table to help you decide which package to use:

| 앱 타입                  | 패키지명                                                                        | 설명                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flutter + [flutter_hooks] | [hooks_riverpod]                                                                   | Allows using both [flutter_hooks] and [Riverpod] together.                    |
| Flutter only              | [flutter_riverpod]                                                                 | A basic way of using [Riverpod] for Flutter applications                      |
| Dart only (No Flutter)    | [riverpod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/river_pod/tree/master/packages/riverpod) | A version of [Riverpod] with all the classes related to Flutter stripped out. |

## 패키지 설치하기

Once you know what package you want to install, proceed to add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="hooks_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter + flutter_hooks', value: 'hooks_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Dart only', value: 'riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="hooks_riverpod">

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">=2.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
  hooks_riverpod: ^2.0.0-dev.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">=2.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.0.0-dev.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0-0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  riverpod: ^2.0.0-dev.0
```

Then run `dart pub get`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. You've added [Riverpod] to your app!

## Usage example: Hello world

Now that we have installed [Riverpod], we can start using it.

The following snippets showcase how to use our new dependency to make a "Hello world":

export const foo = 42;

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="hooks_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: "Flutter + flutter_hooks", value: "hooks_riverpod" },
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter_riverpod" },
    { label: "Dart only", value: "riverpod" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="hooks_riverpod">

<CodeBlock title="lib/main.dart">{trimSnippet(helloWorldHooks)}</CodeBlock>

Which you can then execute with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" on your device.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<CodeBlock title="lib/main.dart">{trimSnippet(helloWorldFlutter)}</CodeBlock>

Which you can then execute with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" in on your device.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

<CodeBlock title="lib/main.dart">{trimSnippet(helloWorldDart)}</CodeBlock>

Which you can then execute with `dart lib/main.dart`.  
This will print "Hello world" in the console.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
